# Solutions for Advent of Code 2017

## Remarks
I haven't cleaned up anything in here. So there is a big chance your input might not work. 
I also switched keyboard layouts half-way through, so my coding style changed a little.

## How to run
Just cd into the specific day and with rust installed run
```
cargo run --release
```
Sometimes you might need to pipe the input to the program
```
cargo run --release < input
```
